# plotImpliedVol
This is an assignment set up by one of my interviewing company. It aims at plotting the Implied Volatility against different strike prices in R. For this, we use bisection method on the Black-Scholes formula to obtain the implied volatility, given the input of the strike price, the option price, the future price, and the time to expiry.

## Usage
- clone the project
- install the packages in R (in terminal it is "R CMD INSTALL plotImpliedVol_0.1.0.tar.gz")
- run the example.R for exploration!
